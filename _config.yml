  My peers know me as an innovative thinker who can see the connections between different projects and initiatives, and that is why I am commonly 
  called upon to produce efficient, profit maximizing solutions, all of which are backed by ample data analysis.

  I completed my B.S. in Economics at Arizona State University in May 2020 alongside a certificate in Applied Business Data Analytics, and I will complete
  my M.S. in Business Analytics at the University of Colorado Boulder in May 2021. I am currently open to both full and part time analytical positions due 
  to the schedule flexibility I have gained through online and hybrid courses as a result of COVID 19.
