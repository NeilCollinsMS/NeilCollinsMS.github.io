  I am an analytical problem solver with a proven track record of success with organizations such as TD Ameritrade and Arizona State University. 
  In my first few months as the Staff Administration Coordinator with Sun Devil Fitness at ASU, I reduced the average onboarding time for new hires 
  by approximately 3 weeks by redesigning and streamlining the hiring process. And in my two summers with TD Ameritrade, I not only instructed the 
  majority of a region on how to use a specialized goal planning software, but I have also spearheaded a variety of data driven initiatives that 
  have improved the practice management of dozens of senior financial consultants. In my time with TD Ameritrade, I was given an incredible amount 
  of space to take initiative, and I have used that space to create data driven performance initiatives that reach far beyond the scope of a normal intern.
  My peers know me as an innovative thinker who can see the connections between different projects and initiatives, and that is why I am commonly 
  called upon to produce efficient, profit maximizing solutions, all of which are backed by ample data analysis.

  I completed my B.S. in Economics at Arizona State University in May 2020 alongside a certificate in Applied Business Data Analytics, and I will complete
  my M.S. in Business Analytics at the University of Colorado Boulder in May 2021. I am currently open to both full and part time analytical positions due 
  to the schedule flexibility I have gained through online and hybrid courses as a result of COVID 19.
